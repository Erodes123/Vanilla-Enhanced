Hi!

Modder here. I will say this mod seems a lot like HPM, which is kinda true, but I just wanted to create a mod that everyone I know could run easily, that had some stuff in it + expansion paths to have way more fun in single/mp games.

I wanna thank everyone who allowed me to use everything from their mods:

Ame: Creator of Parabellum, another awesome mod you should try!

Rennes and Mr: Modders of Napoleon's Legacy Remastered. They have created some very cool stuff there and I wanted to use some of it.

HPM/HFM/GFM are some of the mods that I got inspired from and took some stuff from them, those are also cool, and if you ever have the opportunity to try them, you should!

Victoria Universalis mod, I took the crisis thingy from it, and also it was another source of inspiration.

IPM (Icon Project Mod) also was an inspiration and I think I took some stuff. Try that one as well.

Notice not all decisions/events have localisation. Something I will surely change in the future. Bur for now, the most important thing is to fix bugs.

Wanna also thank Zeldris, who helped me with some desicions. You can take and edit everything in this as long as you don't call your mod the same. :]

This has some flavour I thought was interesting and others mentioned as well. If you ever have ideas, you can comment! I will do my best to add the coolest ones. B)

That's it from me. Hope you like it! <4-1
